1. SMB Signing Not Required (CVSS 5.3 – Medium)
      What is the threat? 
      Attackers can intercept/modify SMB traffic** (for file sharing, printer access, and authentication).  
      Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** that gain credentials, or inject malware.  
      
      Why is this occurring?
      -Standard Windows/Samba defaults allow for **unsigned SMB connections** for compatibility.  
      - Older systems (Windows 7, Server 2008) likely do not require signing by default.   

  How to remediate

    On Windows: 
      1.Open Group Policy Editor 
         - Press `Win + R`, type `gpedit.msc` and hit Enter.  
      2. Locate SMB Signing Options  
         - Navigate to:  
    
   2.  Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → Security Options
  
      - Enable these policies  
        -"Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)"
        - "Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)"  
   3. Apply your settings and reboot 
      - In CMD run `gpupdate /force`, restart the OS.  

     ```  

      Verification 
      - After remediation run **Nessus/OpenVAS** again to confirm that SMB signing is enforced.  
      - On Windows to verify run:  
        ```powershell
        Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select-Object RequireSecuritySignature




2. SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted (CVSS 6.5 – Medium)
  What’s the Risk? 
    - Browsers display **"Not Secure" warnings**, reducing user trust.  
    - MITM attacks** can decrypt/modify traffic (e.g., login pages, sensitive data).  

  Common Causes
   1. Self-signed certificate** (not issued by a Certificate Authority you trust).  
   2. Expired certificate** (after the `notAfter` date).  
   3. Missing intermediate certificates** (incomplete chain).  
   4. Weak crypto** (SHA-1, RSA-1024, algorithms that should not be used).  

    How to Fix It
   
    Windows (IIS):  
     1.   - Use Win-ACME ((https://www.win-acme.com/)) to auto-renew Let’s Encrypt certs.
     
     2.  Buy a Commercial Certificate  
         - Providers: [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/), [Sectigo](https://www.sectigo.com/).  
          - Follow their process to get a **CSR (Certificate Signing Request)**.  


3. Self-Signed Certificate (CVSS 6.5 – Medium)
    Is This Different from 2?
   - Same root cause**, but this plugin specifically flags **self-signed certs** (no CA at all).  

    Best Fix for Production Systems
         - Never use self-signed certs in production.  
         - Use **Let’s Encrypt** (free) or a paid CA.  

    If You Must Use Self-Signed (Internal Labs/Testing)
        1. *Add the cert to trusted stores**:  
            Windows:** Double-click the `.cer` file → "Install Certificate" → "Trusted Root Authorities".  
        2. **Configure clients to ignore cert errors** (not recommended).
